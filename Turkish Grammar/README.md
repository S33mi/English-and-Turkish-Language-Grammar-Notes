There are in total 2 pdf files.

	File one covers grammer from Level A1-A2.
	
	File two covers the grammar section from level B1-B2 complete while level C1 is partialy avaiable.
	
		Which means some pages of level C1 are missing i will upload them when i took pictures of my remaining lecture notes.
		

😅 Just my handwritten notes compiled over time — nothing fancy, but helpful!
