# English and Turkish Language Grammar Notes

Personal collection of grammar notes for English and Turkish (mostly PDFs for quick reference).


## What's Inside

- PDFs covering key topics: tenses, cases, sentence structures, common differences in grammar.

- Useful for self-study, quick reviews, or anyone learning/teaching the languages.

😅 Just my handwritten notes compiled over time — nothing fancy, but helpful!

Feel free to fork or use as inspiration.
